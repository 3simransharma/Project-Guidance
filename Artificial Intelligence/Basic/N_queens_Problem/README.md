# Description
This project is a basic N Queens Problem in Artificial Intelligence. It has typically used the **Heuristic search - Hill Climbing Algorithm**.

# Algorithm
1. Step 1: Evaluate the initial state, if it is goal state then return success and Stop.
2. Step 2: Loop Until a solution is found or there is no new operator left to apply.
3. Step 3: Select and apply an operator to the current state.
4. Step 4: Check new state:
           If it is goal state, then return success and quit.
           Else if it is better than the current state then assign new state as a current state.
           Else if not better than the current state, then return to step2.
5. Step 5: Exit.
